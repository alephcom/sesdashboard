# About Fork
This is a fork of the excellent [SesDashboard by Nikeev](https://github.com/Nikeev/sesdashboard).  Development over there appears to have stopped and there are a few features we wanted to implement.

# About

SesDashboard is a free self-hosted solution which works as stand-alone app. No existing code needs to be changed.
